  <h1><span class="text--highlight">Cashback</span>-System</h1>
  The native Radiator token \$RDT is basically a „reward-token“. We are establishing a network of partnerships throughout the whole Radix ecosystem. Holders of \$RDT will receive \$XRD cashback, when interacting with goods and services from our partners.
  <br><br>
  <h4>$RDT Utility examples:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>discounts when buying NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens)</li>
    <li>reduced DEX (Decentralized Exchanges) Fees</li>
    <li>discounts on software engineering services</li>
  </ul>
  <br><br>
  <h4>The conditions for these utilities are set by our partners and vary from project to project:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>amount of $RDT to hold in the wallet you are using to interact with goods & services</li>
    <li>holding duration</li>
    <li>others (depending on goods & services)</li>
  </ul>
  <br><br>
  In our aim to optimize the value transfer within the Radix ecosystem we give recommendations to our partners on how to set the conditions in the best way for everyone.
