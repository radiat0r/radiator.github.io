<h1>Bonus-System</h1>
<p>\$RDT is the idea of implementing a reward ecosystem within the Radix Network. We aim to partner with many other Projects where you can earn or spend your \$RDT, wether it is a NFT Project, a Validator or a DEX. Imagine buying 3 NFTâ€™s from one of our partnered projects, thus earning \$RDT and use them to save your transaction Fees on a partnered DEX. Multitokenswaps and Royalty Fees makes all this possible and turns \$RDT into a real signature Token for Radix.</p>
<p>$$\frac{stake_{user} \times APY}{100} \times \frac{\sum \$RDT_{user}}{\$RDT_{MAX}}$$</p>
