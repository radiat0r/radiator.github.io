    <h1>Stake with us!</h1>
    <p>
    We are a german community run radix validator node with a 0% fee. Our aim is to contribute to a decentralized financial system. The node runs on a 24/7 monitored ESXi Cluster with automatic backups and zero downtime.
		To optimize updates and possible downtimes, we always have a backup node up and running.
		<br><br>
		Early stakers will receive airdrops of our native \$RDT token! The earlier and the more you stake, the more \$RDT tokens you get.
    Formula for Airdrops:<br>
    <p>$$\frac{\sum stake_{user} \times \sum Airdrop}{\sum stake_{validator}}$$</p>
