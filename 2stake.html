    Our Radiator ("RADix validATOR") node is run by german Radix community members. The node runs on a 24/7 monitored ESXi Cluster with automatic backups. To optimize handling of updates, one node is always up and running.
    Not only will you receive passive income by staking on the Radiator node (\$XRD token with ~9% APY), but also you will receive our \$RDT cashback utility token via frequent airdrops. The more \$XRD you stake, the more \$RDT you will receive. But, everbody will receive a fair share at some point.

      <li>big amount stakers (whales)</li>

    To ensure everybody receives a fair share at some point, the airdrop parameters will change frequently and without prior notice:
